### Welcome!

This was my personal website, once upon a time when it might've been useful for me to have one. Now I suppose it serves as a demo of the kind of website I can generate for you in less time than it takes to do a Torghast run using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).

### About

I graduated from the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) in 2017 with a specialist in Computer Science, major in Biology, and minor in Statistics.

I am currently enrolled in the [Professional Development Program](https://www.sfu.ca/education/teachersed/programs/pdp/overview.html) at [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/), Secondary Sciences stream.

I have a pet western hognose snake (_Heterodon nasicus_)! Her name is Beagle.

### Courses

I was a Teaching Assistant for the following courses at UofT:

- [CSC148H1 - Introduction to Computer Science](https://artsci.calendar.utoronto.ca/section/Computer-Science#courses)
- [CSC165H1 - Mathematical Expression and Reasoning for Computer Science](https://artsci.calendar.utoronto.ca/section/Computer-Science#courses)
- [CSC236H1 - Introduction to the Theory of Computation](https://artsci.calendar.utoronto.ca/section/Computer-Science#courses)


### Projects

I've culled most of my projects in the years since I graduated, but here are a few that remain:

- [Courseography](https://courseography.cdf.toronto.edu/graph) - A set of graphical interactive tools to guide students through their undergraduate careers at UofT. Powered by a [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) backend with a [React](https://reactjs.org/) frontend.

- [FlynnBot](https://discord.com/developers/applications/770906949898338305/information) - Some dumb bot I made for a fandom Discord once because I thought it would be funny. A self-hosted instance of [YAGPDB](https://yagpdb.xyz/).

I have also been a Bioinformatics Research Assistant at the [Chang Lab](https://chang.eeb.utoronto.ca/).


### Resume

You can find a more poorly-formatted version of the resume I used for my Professional Development Program application [here](/assets/resume.pdf).
