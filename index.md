### Welcome!

This was my personal website, once upon a time when it might've been useful for me to have one. Now I suppose it serves as a demo of the kind of website I can generate in less time than it takes to do a Torghast run using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).

### About Me

I graduated from the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) in 2017 with a specialist in computer science, major in biology, and minor in statistics.

I am currently enrolled in the [Professional Development Program](https://www.sfu.ca/education/teachersed/programs/pdp/overview.html) at [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/), with teachables in secondary biology and computer science (who would've guessed?)

I have a pet western hognose snake (_Heterodon nasicus_). Her name is Beagle!

### Courses Taught

I was a Teaching Assistant for the following courses at UofT:

- [CSC148H1](https://artsci.calendar.utoronto.ca/section/Computer-Science#courses) - Introduction to Computer Science
- [CSC165H1](https://artsci.calendar.utoronto.ca/section/Computer-Science#courses) - Mathematical Expression and Reasoning for Computer Science
- [CSC236H1](https://artsci.calendar.utoronto.ca/section/Computer-Science#courses) - Introduction to the Theory of Computation


### Projects

I've culled most of my projects in the years since I switched career paths, but here are a few of the ones that remain:

- [Courseography](https://courseography.cdf.toronto.edu/graph) - A set of graphical interactive tools to guide students through their academic careers at UofT. Powered by a [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) backend and [React](https://reactjs.org/) frontend.

- [FlynnBot](https://discord.com/developers/applications/770906949898338305/information) - Some dumb bot I made for a fandom Discord once because I thought it would be funny. A self-hosted instance of [YAGPDB](https://yagpdb.xyz/).

See my GitHub for the rest.

I have also been a Bioinformatics Research Assistant at the [Chang Lab](https://chang.eeb.utoronto.ca/).


### Resume

I used to link my resume here, but it contained too much personal information for what is now essentially a demo site. Available upon request.
