### Welcome!

This was my personal website, once upon a time when I thought it was cool to have one. Now I suppose it serves as a demo of the kind of website I can generate for you in less time than it takes to do a Torghast run.

### About

I graduated from the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) in 2017 with a specialist in Computer Science, major in Biology, and minor in Statistics. I am currently enrolled in the [Professional Development Program at Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/education/teachersed/programs/pdp/overview.html),

### Teaching

I have a Teaching Assistant for the following courses at UofT:

- [CSC148H1: Introduction to Computer Science](https://artsci.calendar.utoronto.ca/section/Computer-Science#courses)
- [CSC165H1: Mathematical Expression and Reasoning for Computer Science](https://artsci.calendar.utoronto.ca/section/Computer-Science#courses)
- [CSC236H1 - Introduction to the Theory of Computation](https://artsci.calendar.utoronto.ca/section/Computer-Science#courses)

### Projects

I've culled most of my projects in the years since I graduated, but here are a few notable ones:

- [Courseography](https://github.com/Courseography/courseography): A tool created by David Liu and Ian Stewart-Binks to guide students through their undergraduate careers at UofT. Powered by a [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) backend with a [React](https://reactjs.org/) frontend.

- [FlynnBot](https://discord.com/developers/applications/770906949898338305/information): Some dumb bot I made for a fandom Discord once because I thought it would be funny. A self-hosted instance of [YAGPDB](https://yagpdb.xyz/)
